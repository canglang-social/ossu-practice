# OSSU Practice

This repository contains my **practice code and real progress** while working through the **OSSU Computer Science curriculum**.

The goal of this repo is not just to complete courses, but to **build solid CS fundamentals**, improve **problem-solving skills**, and learn how to **think like a computer scientist**.
